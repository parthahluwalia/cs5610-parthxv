        <h2>Description</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
            This experiment demonstrates how to design a responsive home page using CSS and add some effects using JavaScript. 
            To start with let's discuss the CSS part first. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The display picture has been transormed into a circular one, using the border-radius property, setting it to 100%. 
            The contents have been aligned in the center of the page (vertically) by setting the width of the main div containing 
            all the contents to 85% of the screen and adding a uniform padding to both sides. 
            Dislpaying the links to Experiments, Project, Documentation and GitHub uses overlay effects and CSS animations to wrap various 
            contents into one element. For each of these links, their respective title, icon and a short description has been wrapped as a single 
            item by adjusting their relative and absolute positions corresponding to the link image. These are visible only when a user 
            hovers over a respctive link. Also a transparent darkish background image has been associated with each of these link images which appears 
            over the image when a user hovers over the respective link. In order to give the appearance of the wrapped items an animation-easing effect, 
            transition property of CSS has been used with opacity and an ease-in-out time of 0.3s. This gives the transition a smooth delay effect making it 
            more beautiful when a user hovers over it. For the footer icons containing link to social profiles, again font-awesome icons have been used 
            for particualr social networks, and just the background color is changed to "white" as a user hovers over an icon.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to make the web page responsive, @media queries have been used to adjust various element of the page according to the screen width.
        </p>
