<h3>Bootrap CSS</h3>

<p>
    My fourth experiment this week was about using the basic features provided by Boostrap. I designed a 
    page for the upcoming NFL championship, learning various styling elements like jumbotron, block buttons, how one can 
    customize their table rows to include various beautiful elements, without having to worry much about writing their own CSS. 
    You can navigate to the NFL game's various important centers by clicking on the navigation links provided on the page.

    Along with Bootstrap, I also learned about Bootswatch that provides great customization to your Bootstrap themes. 
    My fifth expeirment uses Bootswatch for styling. Here I have exnhanced the NFL championship info page to include various other 
    links like Profile, Stats and Schedule of the teams, along with various other navigation links. 
    I have also used the concept of <b>local storage</b> here, that can allow a peron to post comments. The comments section is styled in a way 
    that the posted comments will be displayed right next to the "Post Comments" box. This uses a simple form elements along 
    with javascript and HTML5 to provide local storage functionality along with other functions.
