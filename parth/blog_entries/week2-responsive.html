<h3>Responsive Design</h3>

<p>
    I started my experiments this week with Responsive Design. The first experiment displayed simple responsive
    divs, that arrange themselves as one adjusts the screen of the browser.

    The second experiment shows that there's more to respnsive images than just media queries. The img tag can be enhanced using srcset and src attributes to
    specify the breakpoints and the corresponding images that a browser will pick up when it reaches that breakpoint.

    My third experiment demonstrates the usage of media queries and navaigation switch. It shows how one can use 
    media queries to customize a full webpage on how it will look when viewed in devices with small screens. The navigation menu 
    has also been customized for the devices with small screens.
