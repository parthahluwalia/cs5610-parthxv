    File: links.htm
    ... Uses a story file to show an unordered list
    ... of the titles in the story file.
    ...
    ... Furthermore each title is a link to its url.
    
    The file links.htm is an enhanced version of the file
    whatisnext.htm.  The new features are described below.


    In the simplest use of a story file for the story
    utility, lines that begin with whitespace are
    treated as comments and ignored.
    
    When using links.htm, information may be embedded
    in these comments that influences the rendered page.
    
    Here are the current tags for embedded information:
    
        !title=...
        !pagetitle=...
        !comment=...
        !heading=...
        !br
        !hr

    The text that follows !title= will be used to replace
    the content of the <title> block in the <head>.  This
    will then be shown in the browser page tab.  Only one
    !title= tag will be processed.
    
    By the way, the default title for the browser page tab
    is: Links.
    

    There may be one or more instances of all other tags.
    Furthermore, the text for a tag may contain snippets
    of html if desired.


    Each !pagetitle= tag will contribute a one line title
    at the top of the web page.

    The tag text line will be inserted into a <div> with
    CSS class='title'.  This <div> will be appended to the
    entity with id='pagetitle'.


    The remaining tags will be used to insert information
    or markup between the links/titles that form the main
    content of the web page.

    The tags !comment= and !heading= are similar.  Both
    insert text in italic style.  A comment is flush left
    whereas a heading is indented 3%.
    
    A comment has class='comment'.

    A heading has class='heading'.


    The tag !br has no associated text.  This tag will
    cause a <br /> to be inserted.


    The tag !hr has no associated text.  This tag will
    cause a <hr /> to be inserted.
