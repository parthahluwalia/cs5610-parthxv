                <span class="ssn-bold">Sentiments Social Network</span> is a Sentiment Analysis Web Application that takes in
                in a subject and subsequenty fetches the tweets related to that subject from Twitter. Each of these tweets is then fed to the
                Sentiment constituent of the app, which is an AFINN word-list powered sentiment analysis module. This constituent of the app
                evaluates the scores for the respective tweets, and the upshot is a comparative mean score generated by the app for the
                gathered tweets.
