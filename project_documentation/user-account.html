            <p class="abstract-para">
                In the Subject Sentiment Module, the bookmark icon will appear only if a user has logged in. The user visits the page, 
                analyze their subject of interst, and a bookmark icon appears upon clicking which the application records the bookmarked subject 
                for the respective user.

                On clicking the Bookmark icon, a message appears <i>"The respective subject has been successfully bookmarked"</i>, if the same 
                subject has not already been bookmarked and being watched by the user.
            </p>
            <p class="abstract-para">
                The bookmarked subjects could be navigated to and viewed any time from the left navbar of current user's account page.

            <p class="abstract-para">
                Since there could be many tweets posted about a subject by anyone on Twitter, the analysis concern 
                is much wider here as compared to a single user. Hence, at any time, we analyze last 15 tweets posted about 
                a subject to evaluate their feelings. The analysis can be viewed by clicking on the "Analysis" button.
