            <hr />
            <p class="abstract-para">
                MongoDB is the leading NoSQL database, empowering businesses to be more agile and scalable.
                MongoDB is an open-source document database that provides high performance, high availability, and automatic scaling.
            </p>
            <p class="abstract-para">
                <h4>Document Database</h4>
                A record in MongoDB is a document, which is a data structure composed of field and value pairs. MongoDB documents are similar to JSON objects. 
            </p>
            <p class="abstract-para">
                <h4>High Performance</h4>
                MongoDB provides high performance data persistence. In particular,
                <ul>
                    <li>Support for embedded data models reduces I/O activity on database system.</li>
                    <li>Indexes support faster queries and can include keys from embedded documents and arrays.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="abstract-para">
                <h4>High Availability</h4>
                To provide high availability, MongoDB’s replication facility, called replica sets, provide:
                <ul>
                    <li>automatic failover.</li>
                    <li>data redundancy.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="abstract-para">
                <h4>Automatic Scaling</h4>
                MongoDB provides horizontal scalability as part of its core functionality.
                <ul>
                    <li>Automatic sharding distributes data across a cluster of machines.</li>
                    <li>Replica sets can provide eventually-consistent reads for low-latency high throughput deployments.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2><b>E</b> - Express</h2>
            <hr />
            <p class="abstract-para">
                Express is a minimal and flexible node.js web application framework, providing a robust set of features for building single and multi-page, and hybrid web applications. 
                EXpress provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node features.
            </p>
            <p class="abstract-para">
                With a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware at your disposal, creating a robust API is quick and easy with Express.

            <h2><b>A</b> - AngularJS</h2>
            <hr />
            <p class="abstract-para">
                AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.
            </p>
            <p class="abstract-para">
                HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it for declaring dynamic views in web-applications. AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.
            </p>
            <p class="abstract-para">
                Other frameworks deal with HTML’s shortcomings by either abstracting away HTML, CSS, and/or JavaScript or by providing an imperative way for manipulating the DOM. Neither of these address the root problem that HTML was not designed for dynamic views.
            </p>
            <p class="abstract-para">
                The extensibility of AngularJS lies in the fact that AngularJS is a toolset for building the framework most suited to your application development. It is fully extensible and works well with other libraries. Every feature can be modified or replaced to suit your unique development workflow and feature needs.
            </p>

            <h2><b>N</b> - node.js</h2>
            <hr />
            <p class="abstract-para">
                Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications.
            </p>
            <p class="abstract-para">
                Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.
