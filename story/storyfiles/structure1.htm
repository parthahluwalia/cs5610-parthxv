<h1 class="center">Story File Structure 1</h1>

<p>
The <b>Story Utility</b> is normally called with a query string
that points to a <b>story file</b>.
A story file provides a <b>list of the links</b> to each
web page that will form a slide in the story.
</p>

<p>
The <i>path-to-a-story-file</i> should be provided as a url that is
placed in the <i>query string</i> when the <b>Story Utility</b> is
invoked.
</p>

<pre class="indent1">..../story/index.htm?<i>path-to-a-story-file</i></pre>

<p>
By default, the story opens with slide 1.  By using an additional 
query parameter <code>start</code>, you may specify the number
<code><i>N</i></code> of the slide to start with.
</p>

<pre class="indent1">..../story/index.htm?<i>path-to-a-story-file</i>&start=<i>N</i></pre>

<p>
Normally, <code><i>N</i></code> should fall between 1 and the total
number of slides.  However, if <code><i>N</i></code> is outside of
this range, then via &ldquo;automatic wraparound&rdquo; the value
will be mapped into the proper range.  For example, the setting
<code>start=0</code> will cause the story to open with the last
slide.
</p>

<p>
A story file should be <b>structured</b> as follows.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Each line in the story file that <i>starts with a non-blank character</i>
should consist of the data for one slide in the story:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>url</code> for a slide in the story</li>
  <li>Whitespace</li>
  <li>The text of a <b>title</b> to identify the slide
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The <b>title</b> may contain whitespace internally.
</p>

<p>
If the <b>title</b> is omitted
then the <code>url</code> will become its own <b>title</b>.
Usually, it is far better to supply an explicit <b>title</b>
for each slide.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Each line in the story file that is <i>empty or starts with a blank</i>
is ignored when constructing the slide show.  This enables spacing and 
comments in the story file.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
If the <i>path-to-a-story-file</i> points to a web directory but omits
the story file name then the story file name is assumed to be
<code>story.txt</code>.
This convention makes it easier to reference a story.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
The structure of a <b>story file</b> is illustrated by the next slide
that shows the <code>story.txt</code> file for this documentation.
