<h1 class="center">The <i class="red">Links</i> Utility</h1>

<p>
The <i class="red">Links</i> utility is a convenient 
helper utility for the <b>Story Utility</b>.
</p>

<p>
The <i class="red">Links</i> utility is intended to be used
either as the first slide in a <b>Story Utility</b> slide show
or as an independent page that provides access to all links in
a story file and can display additional titles, headings, and
comments.
</p>

<p>
In short, the <i class="red">Links</i> utility is fancy version
of the <i class="red">What is Next</i> utility.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
The <i class="red">Links</i> utility will display the titles
present in a story file and each title will be a link to its url.
The url will open in a new tab.  In addition, the
<i class="red">Links</i> utility can display additional titles,
headings, and comments by placing the information needed in lines
of the story file that begin with blank or tab.  These lines are
ignored by the <b>Story Utility</b> and therefore can be used by
the <i class="red">Links</i> utility to provide additional content.
</p>

<p>
The additional content used by the <i class="red">Links</i> utility
is placed on lines that begin with <i>at least one blank or tab</i>.
Then the content is introduced by one of the following tags:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>!title=...</code></li>
  <li><code>!pagetitle=...</code></li>
  <li><code>!comment=...</code></li>
  <li><code>!heading=...</code></li>
  <li><code>!br</code></li>
  <li><code>!hr</code></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>
Let us explain how to use these tags.
</p>

<p>
The tag <code>!title=...</code> is used to set the title that is shown
in the browser tab for the page.  If this tag is omitted, then the
browser tab will show the word &ldquo;Links&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
The tag <code>!title=...</code> may be used only once and may not
include any HTML markup.  The other tags may be used multiple times and
may contain valid snippets of HTML.
</p>

<p>
The tag <code>!pagetitle=...</code> is used to add one or more titles to
the top of the web page.  These page titles will be bold, centered, and
in 140% font size.
</p>

<p>
The auto-generated <i>titles/links</i> associated with the url&rsquo;s
in the story file are displayed in bold with 125% font size.
</p>

<p>
Any additional <i>comments and headings</i> will be displayed in italic
with 125% font size.  Comments and headings must be entered on a single
line in the story file but may render using multiple lines on the page.
In that case, the rendered lines will be justified.
</p>

<p>
The tag <code>!comment=...</code> is used to enter a comment.  A comment
has no indentation, that is, it is flush left.
</p>

<p>
The tag <code>!heading=...</code> is used to enter a heading.  A heading
has left indentation of 3%.
</p>

<p>
In other words, a comment and a heading are the same except for the issue
of indentation.
</p>

<p>
The tag <code>!br</code> tag is used to enter a vertical line break via
the HTML code <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code>.
</p>

<p>
The tag <code>!hr</code> tag is used to enter a horizontal rule via
the HTML code <code>&lt;hr /&gt;</code>.
</p>

<p>
The main content of a story file consists of url&rsquo;s together with
titles for these url&rsquo;s.  By interweaving the comment, heading, br,
and hr tags with this data, one can provide significantly more information
and formatting than by supplying simply a list of titles/links.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
See the following
<a href="../index.htm?minidemo/" target="_blank">Mini Demo</a>
for an example of an introductory page created with the
<i class="red">Links</i> utility.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Call the <i class="red">Links</i> utility via:
</p>

<pre class="indent1">.../story/links.htm?url=...</pre>

<p>
The <code>url=</code> query parameter gives the relative url to
the story text file to be processed.
</p>

<p>
Actually, <code>url=</code> is optional since the utility will
assume that an <i>unnamed query parameter</i> is the
<code>url</code>.
