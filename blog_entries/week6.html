<h3>Node.js</h3>

<p>
    So this week was about node.js. I have tried to utilize various modules in node.js this week and host 
    them rhcloud openshift server. The <a href="../experiments/week6/experiment1.html">second experiment</a> 
    created a simple web API providing JSON response.
</p>

<p>
    In <a href="../experiments/week6/experiment3.html">third,</a> <a href="../experiments/week6/experiment4.html">fourth,</a> 
    <a href="../experiments/week6/experiment5.html">fifth</a> experiments, I have created a simple Sentiment Analysis App 
    where a user could enter a phrase and the application would analyze the phrase and generate the score based on the analysis. 
    I have used sentiment module in node.js which utilizes AFINN based word dictionary to assign polarities. 
</p>

    I have also used Browserify module in this app. Since browsers don't have the require method defined, Browserify lets us write code in the same way that we would it in Node, helping us in clear segregation of code.
