<h3>Routing and Services in AngularJS</h3>

<p>
    This week was about Routing and Services in Angular JS. I learnt a lot of cool stuff this week like how to 
    create utilize multiple controllers in a view. I also learned about the concept of creating services using 
    service factory and consume those services just like the public object $scope in a controller.

    The <a href="../experiments/week5/html/experiment1.html">first experiment</a> demonstrates the basic routing 
    using Angular navigating through links. The <a href="../experiments/week5/html/experiment2.html">seccond expermiment</a> 
    shows how Angular uses MVC design pattern and create simple web API. The <a href="../experiments/week5/html/experiment3.html">third experiment</a> 
    demonstrates a weather app using WeatherOnline API by creating services from a service factory - weatherService. The 
    <a href="../experiments/week5/html/experiment4.html"> fourth experiment </a> extends this app to include the routing functionality, where 
    if a person saves a weather report, he is able to see those saved reports by navigating to "Saved Weather" link. The 
    <a href="../experiments/week5/html/experiment5.html">fifth experiment</a> further extends this application to include 
    login functionality where a user can login to his profile (implemented by creating another service - userService) and 
    and see the saved weather reports.
