<h3>AJAX</h3>

<p>
    This week I performed AJAX and Anguar JS experiments using Web APIs. I have used TV MAZE API in order interact and get data from the Web.
</p>

<p>
    The <a href="../experiments/week4/html/experiment1.html">first experiment</a> I gather details of a TV Show based on the name/title that user enters. 
    Upon gathering the data, I tweak in the HTML tags to render that data in the HTML page. This experiment helped me understand how to handle AJAX calls 
    to a Web API through jQuery and then render the results by creating HTML elements from jQuery.

<p>
    In the <a href="../experiments/week4/html/experiment2.html">second experiment</a>, I enhanced the previous experiment to incorporate the local storage concept in HTML5. 
    The last search results would be stored in the local storage which could be retreived upon clicking the respective button.
