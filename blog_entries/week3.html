<h3>JavaScript and jQuery</h3>

<p>
    So, this week was about JavaScript and jQuery. In the <a href="../experiments/week3/html/experiment1.html">first experiment</a>, I created a simple 
    Revserse Polish Notaion calculator using various constructs of JavaScript framework like regular expressions and event handlers 
    like onFocus, onChange, etc.

<p>
    The <a href="../experiments/week3/html/experiment2.html">second experiment</a> is a basic experiment to display a message from 
    the jQuery framework of JavaScript. While performing this experiment, I learned the concept of callbacks in JQuery and how we can reduce 
    writing the code using jQuery on top of JavaScript.

    The last three exeriments - <a href="../experiments/week3/html/experiment3.html">experiment 3</a>, <a href="../experiments/week3/html/experiment4.html">experiment 4</a> and <a href="../experiments/week3/html/experiment4.html">experiment 5</a> demonstrate a walkthrough showcasing the usage of $.delay() function, jQuery easing plugin
    and CSS transforms to animate the thumbnails in the grid. 
    Upon clicking the Animate button, the thumbnails disappear randomly with a ripple effect, and after all the thumbnails have faden away,
    they storm back into their original places in a cool 3D way. 
    Through these three experiments I learnt how one can use the powerful jQuery's animation api to create cool effects by writing less code.
