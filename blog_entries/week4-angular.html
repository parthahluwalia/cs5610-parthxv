<h3>Angular JS</h3>

<p>
    The <a href="../experiments/week4/html/experiment3.html">third experiment</a> this week was to 
    demonstrate basic directives in Angular JS. I learnt how Angular JS uses MVC design pattern and how 
    the model, view and controller are bound to each other through scope variable.

<p>
    In the <a href="../experiments/week4/html/experiment4.html">fourth experiment</a>, I created a simple application where I coupled Angular JS with TV Maze Web API 
    to cater a user's request for a TV Show and displaying the rendered results to the user. I learnt various directives, 
    for instance ng-repeat that helps automatically binds the objects to the view as and when they are added/removed. It enhanced 
    my understanding of binding in Angular, and how we can do so much of work by writing significantly reducing 
    the lines of code.

    The <a href="../experiments/week4/html/experiment5.html">fifth experiment</a> enhances the last experiment to include a Favorites list 
    where a user can add his favorite TV shows pertaining to a session. A user can further view the list of episodes 
    of any one of his favorite TV shows. While performing this experiment I learnt how to handle multiple HTTP requests 
    from Angular and render the response.
