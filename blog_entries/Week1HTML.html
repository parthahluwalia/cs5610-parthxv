<h3>HTML5 Experiments</h3>

<p>
    Okay, we should start back! As there are a colossal number of HTML tags, my HTML experiments in 
    Web Development course tries to cover some of the new tags introduced in HTML(5) that may be useful 
    while creating HTML pages.
</p>

<p>
    In my <a href="../experiments/html5/experiment1.html">first experiment</a>, I have used and described
    about the new semantic/structural elements in HTML(5). The most useful tags I found here were
    &lt;ruby&gt;/&lt;rt&gt;, and &lt;menuitem&gt; tags. This is because, the &lt;ruby&gt; and &lt;rt&gt; 
    tags help you to specify what to show in browsers that do not support ruby annotations, and the 
    &lt;menuitem&gt; tag helps you to customize the right click menu that may be useful in many websites. 
    Although, the &lt;menuitem&gt; tag is currently not supported in many popular browsers, but I think its 
    very convenient way to customize your right click menu.

<p>
    In the <a href="../experiments/html5/experiment2.html">second experiment</a>, I have shown how to use
    the canvas element of HTML(5). It demonstrates how we can save and restore the various states of a canvas 
    by drawing overlapping rectangles of different dimensions, where each rectangle is a canvas state. I have also 
    shown a transformation - translation - of an object (rectangle) on canvas. Each rectangle on a row is a translated 
    instance obtained by restoring the state of the previous rectangle. In order to perform all these canvas operations, 
    I created this <a href="../fileview/Default.aspx?~/experiments/html5/canvas.js">JavaScript</a> file. 
    There are various other transformations and animations that can be performed on the canvas element.
