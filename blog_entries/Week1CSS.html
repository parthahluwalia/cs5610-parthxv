<h3>CSS Experiments</h3>

<p>
    My <a href="../experiments/html5/css/html/cssExp1.html">third experiment</a> describes how one can use 
    inline CSS and internal style sheets. The inline style is specified inside an HTML element 
    whereas the internal style sheet is specified in the head section, within the &lt;style&gt; tag. 
    While performing this expriment, I learned that all the styles cascade into a new "virtual" style 
    sheet according to some rules. These rules give the highest priority to the inline style followed by 
    the internal style sheet. This means that an inline style will override a style defined inside the 
    &lt;head&gt; tag.

    In the <a href="../experiments/html5/css/html/cssExp2.html">fourth experiment, </a> I learned how to 
    use an external style sheet. In this experiment, I customized a link to transform it into a button 
    look-alike using the webkit and mozilla CSS extensions. I utilized a tiny feature of JavaScript to 
    show the description on click of this customized button. I also learned that external style sheet has 
    the least priority of the three styles - Inline, Internal and External - meaning the inline and internal 
    overridde a style defined in an external style sheet in the aforementioned order.
